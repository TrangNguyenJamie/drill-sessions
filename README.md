# Drill Sessions
For those who dives into Software Engineering.

## How to get started
1. Fork this repository and clone the forked one in your machine.

2. Read through each `README.md` of the individual sessions under `/sessions` directory.

3. Do the exercises specified at the end of the material following the instructions. Make changes on your machine and make commits. 

But make sure for each session:
- Branch off the `main` branch and name it as `{{your_name}}-session-{{current_session_number}}`, and commit your results on that branch. For example, if your name is `bradley` and the current session is `2`, then the branch name will be `bradley-session-2`. 
- Push your commits and make a PR(Pull Request) to your forked repository.
- Invite `@sungjuyea-rna` to your forked repository and ask for review.
- Once it is approved, merge to the `main` branch.
