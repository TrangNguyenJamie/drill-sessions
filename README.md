# Drill Sessions
For those who dives into Software Engineering.

## Prerequisites
- We assume that your machine is either MacOS or WSL2, as the sessions will be working in Unix environments. 
- Visual Studio Code will be our IDE. At the moment we don't consider other IDEs yet.

## How to get started
1. Fork this repository and clone the forked one in your machine.
- See how to fork if you're not familiar with it: GitHub: [Fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

2. Read through each `README.md` of the individual sessions under `/sessions` directory.
Each session consists of two main sections. First is "Why", which is about why we need to learn the concepts and tools introduced in the session. Second is "Exercises". But rather than listing up bunch of exercises without any context, we will provide necessary materials that will help you to solve the problems.

3. Do the exercises specified at the end of the material following the instructions. Make changes on your machine and make commits. 

But make sure for each session:
- Branch off the `main` branch and name it as `{{your_name}}-session-{{current_session_number}}`, and commit your results on that branch. For example, if your name is `bradley` and the current session is `02`, then the branch name will be `bradley-session-02`. 
- Push your commits and make a PR(Pull Request) to your forked repository.
- Invite `@sungjuyea-rna` to your forked repository and ask for review.
- Once it is approved, merge to the `main` branch.

## Useful References
The following materials will be frequently mentioned throughout the sessions. As the sessions are more focused on practices, we expect you to read and understand on your own. The sessions will only provide you pieces of guidance.
